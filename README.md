# TumorInsight
The TumorTrace project seeks to create an automated system for the identification and segmentation of tumor regions in brain MRI images. Precise segmentation is essential for effective diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of brain tumors. This initiative employs the U-Net architecture, a widely recognized deep learning model specifically tailored for image segmentation tasks in the medical field. Our objective is to deliver a reliable solution for automated tumor detection, significantly enhancing clinical decision-making processes.
